This folder contains examples of "calculator" programs in F# and Java tha read an arithmetic expression from the command line and print the result of evaluating such expression.

## Files
* [Calculator.g](Calculator.g): The ANTLR4 grammar for arithmetic expressions.
* [Calculator.java](Calculator.java): The Java calculator, which uses the parser generated by ANTLR4.
* ...

## Instructions for F#

TBD.

## Instructions for Java/ANTLR

This is instructions assume that you have followed the guidelines to get started with Java and ANTLR4 and that you are using a terminal on a folder contaning [Calculator.g](Calculator.g) and [Calculator.java](Calculator.java).

Generate the visitor-based parser with

```
antlr4 --visitor Calculator.java
```

Compile the program with

```
javac *.java
```

Run the program with

```
java Calculator
```

You should be able to interact witht the calculator program as follows:

```
Enter an arithmetic expression: 1
1.0
Enter an arithmetic expression: 1 + 2
3.0
Enter an arithmetic expression: 1 + 2 * 3
7.0
```
